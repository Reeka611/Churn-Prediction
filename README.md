# Churn-Prediction
Analysing &amp; predicting customer churn in telecom industry using machine learning models
DESCRIPTION:
	Churn(which is loss of customers to competition) is a problem for telecom companies because it is expensive to acquire a new customer and companies want to retain their existing customers.
	For a Telecom Company “X”, Churn is a problem for their business and churn rates have been increasing steadily over the last 1 year.

	The Company wants to find out the factors influencing Customer Churn and to target the specific factors with offers more in-line with other service providers, which could help them to retain customers.
OBJECTIVES:
	To predict Customer Churn.
	Highlighting the main variables\factors influencing Customer Churn.
	Use various Machine Learning algorithms to build prediction models, evaluate the accuracy and performance of these models.
	Finding out the best model and providing final conclusion.
